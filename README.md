# UnderGraphArea
This is a program to approximate the under graph area with a given function. This too was my grade 12 project and has many limitations. This is a program I run using "ready to Program" IDE, so the program is using HSA Console which can't be normally described as java. However, the idea is right and can be edited into real java. (Which may be implemented in the later version of this project) The input of the function is not flexible enough due to the limitations of the IDE and my skills limitations. However, this is a math-based program, so it should be easily understood by beginners.
Also, this program includes a output text file feature. So a text file named area.txt should be included in the same folder when running. The file records the Xs and Ys of the rectangles the user chose to approximated with which may gives a closer look at how the approximation is made.
